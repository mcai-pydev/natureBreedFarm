    content: `Goat Farming Best Practices:
    1. Housing: Provide clean, dry, and well-ventilated shelters with at least 15-20 sq ft per adult goat.
    2. Nutrition: Feed a balanced diet of forage (grass/hay), browse (leaves/shrubs), and concentrates.
    3. Health management: Regular deworming every 3-4 months, vaccination against enterotoxemia and tetanus.
    4. Breeding: Females reach breeding age at 7-10 months; pregnancy lasts 145-155 days.
    5. Common breeds: Boer (meat), Saanen (dairy), Nubian (dual-purpose), Nigerian Dwarf (small dairy).
    6. Water requirements: Clean, fresh water should always be available, about 1-3 gallons per day depending on size.
    7. Common diseases: Pneumonia, enterotoxemia, parasites, foot rot, and CAE (Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis).`
  },
  {
    topic: "fish-farming",
    content: `Fish Farming Best Practices:
    1. Water quality: Maintain pH 6.5-9.0, oxygen levels above 5mg/L, ammonia below 0.02mg/L.
    2. Stocking density: Typically 1-3 kg fish per cubic meter for extensive systems, 15-40 kg/mÂ³ for intensive.
    3. Feeding: Feed 2-5% of body weight daily, adjust based on temperature and fish size.
    4. Common species: Tilapia, catfish, trout, carp, and salmon.
    5. Systems: Pond culture, raceways, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), cage culture.
    6. Disease management: Regular monitoring, proper quarantine of new stock, maintaining optimal water conditions.
    7. Harvesting: Typically when fish reach market size, using nets or draining ponds.`

  {
    topic: "duck-farming",
    content: `Duck Farming Best Practices:
    1. Housing: Minimum 4 sq ft per duck indoors, access to outdoor space and swimming water.
    2. Nutrition: Feed 16-20% protein starter feed for ducklings, 14-16% for adults, plus greens.
    3. Water: Ducks need water for drinking and cleaning their bills and eyes; provide water deep enough to submerge their heads.
    4. Common breeds: Pekin (meat), Khaki Campbell (eggs), Indian Runner (eggs), Muscovy (meat).
    5. Egg production: Good laying breeds produce 250-300 eggs annually.
    6. Health: Ducks are generally hardy but watch for niacin deficiency in ducklings, botulism, and parasites.
    7. Predator protection: Secure housing at night against foxes, raccoons, and other predators.`

  {
    topic: "chicken-farming",
    content: `Chicken Farming Best Practices:
    1. Housing: 2-3 sq ft per bird inside coop, 8-10 sq ft per bird in run area.
    2. Feeding: Chicks need starter feed (18-20% protein), layers need layer feed (16-18% protein) plus calcium supplement.
    3. Egg production: Most laying hens begin producing at 5-6 months, averaging 250-300 eggs in first year.
    4. Common breeds: Leghorn (eggs), Rhode Island Red (dual), Cornish Cross (meat), Orpington (dual).
    5. Health management: Regular deworming, vaccination against Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, and infectious bronchitis.
    6. Lighting: Layers need 14-16 hours of light daily for optimal production.
    7. Common issues: Mites, lice, respiratory infections, egg binding.`

    topic: "crop-farming",
    content: `Crop Farming Best Practices:
    1. Soil preparation: Test soil pH and nutrient levels, aim for pH 6.0-7.0 for most crops.
    2. Crop rotation: Rotate crop families to prevent disease buildup and maintain soil health.
    3. Irrigation: Most crops need 1-1.5 inches of water weekly from rain or irrigation.
    4. Pest management: Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines cultural, biological, and chemical controls.
    5. Fertilization: Apply based on soil tests and crop requirements, typically N-P-K plus micronutrients.
    6. Weed control: Mulching, cultivation, crop rotation, and selective herbicides as needed.
    7. Harvest timing: Crops have specific maturity indicators; harvesting at peak quality maximizes value.`
  },
  {
    topic: "sustainable-farming",
    content: `Sustainable Farming Practices:
    1. Cover cropping: Plant non-cash crops to build soil, prevent erosion, and suppress weeds.
    2. Composting: Convert farm waste into valuable soil amendments.
    3. Polyculture: Growing multiple crops together to increase biodiversity and resilience.
    4. Water conservation: Drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, and soil moisture monitoring.
    5. Integrated livestock: Animals provide manure for fertilizer and can utilize crop residues.
    6. Reduced tillage: Minimizing soil disturbance preserves soil structure and carbon.
    7. Natural pest control: Encouraging beneficial insects, companion planting, and biological controls.`
  },
  {
    topic: "farm-business",
    content: `Farm Business Management:
    1. Record keeping: Track expenses, income, production data, and labor hours.
    2. Marketing: Direct-to-consumer, wholesale, farmers markets, CSAs, or co-ops.
    3. Value-added products: Processing raw farm products into higher-value items (cheese, preserves, etc.).
    4. Diversification: Multiple revenue streams protect against market/crop failures.
    5. Financial planning: Cash flow projections, enterprise budgets, and long-term investment strategies.
    6. Risk management: Crop insurance, forward contracts, futures/options, and emergency funds.
    7. Labor management: Fair compensation, clear expectations, and proper training.`

    topic: "animal-health",
    content: `Farm Animal Health Management:
    1. Preventive care: Regular vaccinations, parasite control, and health screenings.
    2. Biosecurity: Protocols for visitors, new animals, equipment, and feed to prevent disease introduction.
    3. Nutrition: Species-appropriate, balanced rations that adjust with growth stage and production level.
    4. Housing: Clean, dry, well-ventilated facilities with appropriate space allowances.
    5. Stress reduction: Minimize handling stress, provide environmental enrichment, maintain consistent routines.
    6. Record keeping: Track treatments, vaccinations, and health events for each animal or group.
    7. Working with veterinarians: Establish a relationship before emergencies, follow veterinary protocols.`
