📢 Developer Coordination Message from Project Mentor
Team, thank you for your hard work so far. But now, it's time for full strategic focus.

Despite providing detailed guidance, clear task breakdowns, and a project vision that emphasizes stability, simplicity, and social impact, we are still encountering:

🚫 Login inconsistencies after PostgreSQL migration

🔄 Incomplete or non-persistent fixes (things work temporarily, then break again)

🧱 Inactive or broken UI components (e.g. Shop, Order History, Quick Links)

⛔️ Lack of clear state visibility and proper health tracking for critical routes

🚨 We need to immediately align around these principles:
🔒 No feature is marked “done” until it has been:

Verified working on local and Replit

Listed in the /status boot report as ✅

Tested by logging in with a real user (admin + new account)

Viewable in the browser, without console errors

📌 Developer Task: Urgent Core Stabilization
You are all kindly required to do the following before pushing new features:

✅ Fix authentication fully

Admin login must persist and succeed across refresh

Register ➝ Login ➝ Navigate ➝ Logout ➝ Repeat should all work

Use debug logs in /auth and boot to verify this cycle

🛒 Make the ShopPage load error-free

Return real seeded data or mock fallback

Add clear loading/empty/error UI states

Track in boot status

📦 Fix Order History route

Use correct role check (admin vs user)

Show real order data or fallback notice

Link to boot health

🐇 Verify Rabbit Breeding Page

Compatibility checker works? ✅

Dashboard loads real data? ✅

Export works? ✅

All subcomponents render on refresh? ✅

Route /breeding/rabbits should be visible only to allowed roles

🧪 Test and record with screenshots or logs

Especially around auth and boot health

Post success screenshots to #status-check (or issue comments)

💬 Friendly but Firm Reminder
If a task has already been assigned and explained, please do not ask “should I work on X?” — just take it, finish it well, and report completion clearly.

We’re building something meaningful for rural farmers and real-world impact. We can’t afford confusion, duplication, or delay at this stage.
