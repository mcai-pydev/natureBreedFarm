Finalized Developer Task
Title: Split Rabbit Breeding System into Independent Smart Module

🧭 Goal
Isolate the Rabbit Breeding feature into its own dedicated micro-app (or directory structure), to allow focused development, easier testing, and modular AI integration.

🧱 Tasks Breakdown
1️⃣ Modular Extraction
 Move RabbitBreedingPage.tsx + related logic from /pages → apps/rabbit-breeding/

 If preferred, extract into separate repo: natureBreedRabbitApp

 Export animal types/interfaces to @/types/animal.ts or shared lib

2️⃣ Standalone Routing + Page Control
 Set up routing inside the new app: / → RabbitDashboard

 Setup fallback route: /404 or invalid redirect

 Add a base layout: layouts/RabbitLayout.tsx

3️⃣ Shared API Logic
 Keep using /api/animals?type=rabbit for now

 Refactor fetching logic into lib/animal-service.ts (shared)

 Abstract getRabbitStats() and getBreedingPairs() to reuse logic

4️⃣ Sidebar/Menu Strategy
 🕳️ Temporarily remove rabbit link from main sidebar

 If deployed separately, redirect to rabbit.naturebreedfarm.org

 Mark the nav link as external: true in menu config

5️⃣ Algorithm Sandbox (🐇 AI R&D Area)
 Create /sandbox/ page with these sub-modules:

 🧬 Parent pairing validator

 🔄 Inbreeding risk estimator

 🌱 Genetic diversity visualizer (future)

 🧠 Breeding plan assistant (AI support)

6️⃣ Smart Boot Compatibility
 Integrate smart boot checks for this app (boot.ts)

 Optional: expose /api/health endpoint

 Optional: push boot status to main app via webhook or API

7️⃣ Optional: AI Assistant Beta
 Integrate openai or local LLM under /sandbox/assistant

 Text + Voice input (with whisper or open source fallback)

 Provide voice/text summary of breeding results for illiterate farmers

🧠 Notes for Developers
🛠️ This is temporary extraction, meant to keep iteration fast

🪄 When stable, re-integrate into main platform or keep as optional plug-in module

💡 This is our first test of "ecosystem-style modular architecture" — keep it clean, atomic, and document changes well

📚 Deliverables
 A working, bootable rabbit-breeding app (or module)
