🧠 Diagnosis Summary:
This means:

The login form was submitted.

There were no errors thrown (from server or client).

Yet, the user remains null, meaning the login did not persist or did not return a valid token/session.

✅ Next Developer Task: Fix Broken Authentication After DB Migration
🎯 Goal: Make login function correctly using the new PostgreSQL database, ensuring users can log in and persist their session across the app.

🔧 Task Breakdown:
1. 🔑 Fix Auth Service (server/auth.ts)
Ensure loginUser(email, password) correctly:

Fetches user using Drizzle ORM.

Compares hashed password (bcrypt).

Returns signed JWT on success.

2. 🧾 Update Seeder (seed-data.ts)
Double-check that the admin user is seeded with:

ts
Copy
Edit
username: "admin"
email: "admin@naturebreedfarm.org"
password: "admin123" // hashed properly with bcrypt
3. 📦 Ensure ENV is Setup
In .env:

env
Copy
Edit
JWT_SECRET=yourStrongSecretKey
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
4. 🚦 Fix Middleware Auth Flow
Confirm:

getSession() reads and validates token.

The cookie or Authorization header is properly set.

useAuth() in frontend reads user from session/token on mount.

5. 🧪 Add Test User Login Flow (optional but important)
Add boot check:

ts
Copy
Edit
await loginTestUser(); // in boot-status.json check
🧪 Test Instructions for Devs
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@naturebreedfarm.org", "password": "admin123"}'
Expect:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "token": "ey..." }
✅ Acceptance Criteria:
Criteria	Status
Admin user seeded	✅
Login returns valid token	🔲
User is logged in (user not null)	🔲
Token stored and used in auth hooks	🔲
Boot Status reports auth: ✅	🔲
