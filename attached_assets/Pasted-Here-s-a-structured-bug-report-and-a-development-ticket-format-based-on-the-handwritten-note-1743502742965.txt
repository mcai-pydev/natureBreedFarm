## 🐞 **Structured Bug Report**

### Title: Various UI/UX and Functional Issues in Registration and Chat Flow

---

**Environment:**  
Platform/OS: [e.g., Android/iOS/Web]  
App Version: [e.g., v1.0.3]  
User: Mcenoch Oforha

---

**Reported Issues:**

1. **Password Field Visibility**
   - ❌ Password is not visible (possibly missing “show password” option or input is obscured).
   - 🔒 No visibility toggle available.

2. **Navigation:**
   - 🔼 “Back” button (triangle symbol) does not return to the previous page.

3. **Chat:**
   - Cannot enter the chat section (click has no effect or transition fails).
   - When both checkboxes are selected, the image turns green unexpectedly.

4. **Email Field:**
   - Only clean email address should be allowed; current input might accept non-email strings.

---

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Go to registration form.
2. Enter password → observe no visibility toggle.
3. Navigate to overview screen → try to go back using arrow button.
4. Try to enter chat → observe failure.
5. Enter invalid email → check validation.

---

**Expected Behavior:**

- Password should have a toggle for visibility.
- Back navigation should return to the previous screen.
- Chat should be accessible upon click.
- Email input should validate email-only strings.

**Attachments:**

### Epic: App Polish and UX Improvements  
**Assignee:** [Developer Name]  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Sprint:** [Sprint Name / Date Range]

---

**Task Breakdown:**

1. **Design Improvements:**
   - Improve layout of the **Home screen** – integrate logo more aesthetically.
   - Set default **language selection** in user profile or onboarding.

2. **Form Field Enhancements:**
   - Place “Name” input in a single line.
   - Replace term “Dozen” with "10 pcs" (context: likely refers to eggs).
   - Clarify use of “Goat milk” – verify if it’s linked to currency conversion or pricing.
   - Add **photo upload** option if needed.

3. **Navigation & UX:**
   - Fix “Back” arrow button behavior on overview screen.
   - Allow access to Chat screen.
   - Checkbox interaction should not unintentionally change image color (fix logic).

4. **Contact Info Section:**
   - Email input field must enforce proper email format.
   - Add WhatsApp as an optional contact method.

---

**Notes:**
- Green image might indicate a status, ensure it's only triggered under the right conditions.
- Align wording with intended user language and clarity (e.g., replace ambiguous terms).
