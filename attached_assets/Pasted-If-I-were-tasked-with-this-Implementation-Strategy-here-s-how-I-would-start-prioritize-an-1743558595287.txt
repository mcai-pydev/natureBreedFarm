If I were tasked with this **Implementation Strategy**, here's how I would **start, prioritize**, and **justify** each step:

---

### ‚úÖ **Start with Phase 1: Mobile-First Modularization**

#### Why?
- **Foundation First**: Phase 1 sets the **technical groundwork** for everything that follows. Without centralizing mobile detection and standardizing layout behavior, later modules (like Dashboard or Shop) could inherit inconsistent behavior.
- **Efficiency Multiplier**: Fixing layout and mobile responsiveness at the core level ensures **less rework** in Phases 2‚Äì4.
- **Reusable Components**: Once layout components and menus are mobile-optimized and consistent, they can be reused across the rest of the app, saving time later.

---

### üöÄ Execution Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Mobile-First Modularization (1‚Äì2 days)**

1. **Create central mobile detection utility**  
   - Use a hook or service (e.g., `useIsMobile()` or a responsive context).
   - Allows conditionally rendering mobile vs. desktop behavior consistently.

2. **Standardize mobile menu implementation**
   - Convert all modules to use a **shared, modular mobile menu** (like a drawer or bottom nav).
   - Promotes consistency across pages.

3. **Fix current responsive design issues**
   - Audit layout components (grid, sidebar, navs, cards).
   - Use CSS flex/grid and breakpoints (`@media`) to fix mobile overflow, spacing, or scaling issues.

---

### üß† Strategic Justification:
- Starting at Phase 1 ensures a **mobile-first mindset** is baked into the entire UI.
- It avoids ‚Äúpatchwork fixes‚Äù in individual modules and instead ensures **cohesive design**.
- Phases 2 to 4 depend on this cleanup for faster, smoother implementation.
- Helps enforce a **design system approach** ‚Äî components that work well everywhere.

Once Phase 1 is complete and tested, I‚Äôd move **sequentially through the phases** (Dashboard ‚Üí Shop ‚Üí Breeding), with a buffer day for Phase 5 to handle edge cases or polish.
