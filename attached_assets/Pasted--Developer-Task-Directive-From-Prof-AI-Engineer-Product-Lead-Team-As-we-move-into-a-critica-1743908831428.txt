📣 Developer Task Directive (From Prof. AI Engineer & Product Lead)
Team,

As we move into a critical stabilization phase, we need to urgently resolve the following issues and push the system into testable, shippable state. Below are the top priorities as of now, categorized clearly.

✅ URGENT FIXES (Auth, Pages, Role Logic)
Login System

Re-seed admin user in PostgreSQL (admin@naturebreedfarm.org / admin123)

Ensure bcrypt hash + JWT_SECRET compatibility

Add /api/health/auth to check login working on boot

Page Access Permissions

/orders throws "Access Denied" → standardize role === "admin" logic

/shop throws error → fix missing or broken query on product fetch

Re-enable all quick links with correct route check + fallback UI if no data

Navigation and Role Control

Only show links/pages relevant to the user’s role

Add proper fallback/error pages for unauthorized access

🐰 RABBIT BREEDING MODULE FINALIZATION
This module is a top showcase. It must be production ready for live farmer testing!

 Compatibility algorithm + form validation

 Compatibility result logging + export

 Add /api/breeding/history/export/pdf for formatted history

 Implement health badge component for genetic pair risk

 MVP AI suggestion tool (text/voice input for rabbit pairing)

🛠️ SMART BOOT INTEGRATION & MONITORING
Add /api/boot/compatibility-status

Track UI component health in boot-status.json

Add test login + shop fetch on boot (to catch these errors early)

🌿 MONGODB RESEARCH SYSTEM INITIATION
Create research schema:

{ title, url, category: "soil" | "crop" | "snail" | "fish" | ... }

Start wget or curl scripts from reliable research article sources

Store documents in MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose

Track import job status in /api/health/research

🧪 REGRESSION & STABILITY TASKS
 Add test flow: new user registration → login → see correct nav links

 Fix order history table (if orders exist, render properly)

 Verify role checks for admin, farmer, guest

 Rewire Quick Action Links (check if inactive or throw error)

📚 DOCS & COMMUNICATION
Please document changes in the developer wiki

Record your decisions and routes in a /docs/logs/ folder

Keep Rabbit Breeding README updated per module

👨‍🔬 Final Notes from Prof. AI Engineer This system must be testable by field agents starting soon. Focus on reliability over speed. You’re authorized to refactor brittle parts but log every change. Collaborate, test, and push a clean, working release.

Let’s get this done — the farmers are waiting.
