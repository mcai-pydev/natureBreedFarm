Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs continue with how I‚Äôd **carry out the rest of the implementation**, phase by phase, keeping the mobile-first strategy and user experience in focus:

---

### üìä **Phase 2: Dashboard Mobile Optimization (1‚Äì2 days)**

#### Goals:
- Ensure key metrics and views are **readable and usable** on small screens.
- Make interactions **intuitive** using collapsible sections and swipe navigation.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Responsive Dashboard Cards**
   - Use flexbox/grid with breakpoints to stack cards vertically on smaller screens.
   - Prioritize what‚Äôs visible ‚Äúabove the fold.‚Äù

2. **Collapsible Sections**
   - Convert panels or groups of metrics into collapsible accordions for mobile.
   - Helps reduce clutter and cognitive load.

3. **Swipe Navigation**
   - Use a gesture library (like `react-swipeable` or native touch events) to allow left/right swipe between dashboards or tabs.
   - Optional: Add a visual cue (dot indicator or arrows) for navigation hints.

#### Why This Phase Now?
- After laying the groundwork in Phase 1, we can now make **user-facing modules shine** on mobile.
- The dashboard is often the **first thing users see** ‚Äî it should be mobile-optimized early to boost first impressions.

### üõí **Phase 3: Shop Module Enhancement (2‚Äì3 days)**

#### Goals:
- Fix stability issues (type errors) and improve mobile shopping experience.
- Ensure mobile users can easily browse, filter, and checkout.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Fix Type Errors**
   - Resolve TypeScript issues or runtime errors to ensure stability.
   - Focus on forms, API types, and product structures.

2. **Touch-Friendly Filters**
   - Replace dropdowns or checkboxes with **slidable chips**, toggle buttons, or tap-friendly UI.
   - Prioritize thumb-friendly interaction zones.

3. **Mobile Checkout Flow**
   - Break checkout into **scrollable steps** or a vertical wizard.
   - Ensure all buttons are clearly tappable, avoid form overload.

#### Why Now?
- E-commerce flows on mobile are **conversion-critical** ‚Äî poor UX leads to drop-offs.
- Cleaning up errors early improves developer velocity and testability.

### üê∞ **Phase 4: Rabbit Breeding Module (2‚Äì3 days)**

#### Goals:
- Adapt a potentially complex feature for small screens.
- Maintain clarity in data-heavy UI (pairing, family trees).

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Simplify Breeding Interface**
   - Use card-based selection for breeding pairs.
   - Prioritize readability: larger fonts, less dense info per view.

2. **Touch-Friendly Selection**
   - Use icons, sliders, or draggable components to pair rabbits.

3. **Optimize Family Tree View**
   - Use vertical layout or scrollable tree (e.g., mind-map style).
   - Consider a modal or overlay for deeper views.

#### Why in Phase 4?
- This module is more **niche or advanced**, and likely used by fewer users early on.
- Complex UIs require prior layout and gesture systems to be stable (from earlier phases).

### ‚úÖ **Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (1 day)**

#### Tasks:
- **Cross-device testing:** Use real devices + simulators.
- **Performance Profiling:** Lighthouse mobile audit, load times.
- **Visual QA:** Consistency check for fonts, spacing, padding, colors.

#### Output:
- Fix any performance bottlenecks.
- Polish UI elements, check button tap zones, scroll behaviors.
