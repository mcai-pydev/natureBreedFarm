🩺 SYSTEM STATUS SUMMARY
✅ Database is connected (via NeonDB)
⚠️ Admin user was seeded but login fails intermittently
⚠️ Session token likely not persisting correctly after login
❌ Role-based permissions are not working as expected
❌ Auth-protected routes (e.g., /orders) deny access even to admin
⚠️ Rabbit Breeding module page exists but behavior may be inconsistent
✅ All frontend routes are defined and mapped properly
📸 Debug shows user: null, which confirms a JWT/session issue

🚧 NEXT DEVELOPER TASKS
🔐 1. Fix Authentication & Session Persistence
 Fix JWT cookie/session persistence after successful login

 Validate token with every refresh using useAuth() hook

 Ensure JWT cookie is set with httpOnly, secure, and SameSite=Lax in production

 Cross-check login response and setUser state in frontend

 Validate AuthProvider properly wraps <Router>

👤 2. Fix Admin User Logic
 Re-seed the admin user with isAdmin: true in the database

 Fix getUserByEmail() and loginUser() to pull user roles from PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM

 If admin login fails again, re-check bcrypt hash and JWT_SECRET

🛡️ 3. Correct Route Protection
 Ensure /orders, /reports, /transactions, /dashboard, /breeding/rabbits check:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (!user || !user.isAdmin) redirectTo('/auth')
 Add fallback UI for “Access Denied” with helpful message

 Add route tests for protected access with/without login

🐇 4. Rabbit Breeding Module Final Stabilization
 Verify /breeding/rabbits works end-to-end:

 Shows full rabbit list

 Loads suggestions, compatibility checks

 Timeline and event form works

 Export buttons (CSV, PDF) work with actual data

 Add a "breeding quick start" onboarding tooltip or helper modal

🔁 5. Auth Boot Status Integration
 Update Smart Boot to track:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  auth: {
    status: "ok" | "fail",
    lastLoginTest: "2025-04-06T...",
    details: "Admin login passed"
  }
}
✅ OPTIONAL FINAL CHECKLIST
Task	Status
Admin login working	⛔️
Auth token saved in browser	⛔️
Protected routes redirect properly	⛔️
Rabbit Breeding UI loads	✅
Rabbit data from /api/animals	✅
Compatibility checks	✅
Export buttons (CSV, PDF)	✅
🧠 NEXT STRATEGIC GOALS (once login is stable)
 Refactor all buttons/features to show/hide based on role (admin vs user)

 Separate rabbit.naturebreedfarm.org micro-app when module is stable

 Add test account for farmer role and validate UI restrictions
