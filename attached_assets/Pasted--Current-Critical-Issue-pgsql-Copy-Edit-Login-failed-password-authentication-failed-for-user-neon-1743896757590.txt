Login failed
password authentication failed for user "neondb_owner"
✅ Root Cause
Your app successfully connects to the Neon PostgreSQL server, but:

The login user credentials in .env or the database configuration are either incorrect or not aligned with what's actually on the Neon database.

Likely culprit: the PGPASSWORD or PGUSER is wrong, or Neon’s access control settings haven’t been updated.

✅ Immediate Developer Task – Final Login & Auth Fix
🔧 Title:
Fix PostgreSQL Login Failure & Complete Auth Integration

📌 Description:
Resolve the PostgreSQL login failure that blocks admin authentication via the login UI. Ensure that the credentials used in the .env file match those provisioned on Neon or any connected PostgreSQL database. This task is blocking all other functionality.

✅ Acceptance Criteria:
Database Access Fix

 Ensure that the user neondb_owner exists in Neon

 Ensure the password npg_S5wrqXcnP0RM (or the real one) is correctly set

 Test DB connection with psql or any Postgres GUI using these credentials

Fix .env and Deployment Secrets

 .env and Replit Secrets must include a working DATABASE_URL

env
Copy
Edit
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:correct-password@ep-bold-shad.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
 Set and confirm correct values in Replit "Secrets" (Deploy > Secrets)

Confirm Drizzle ORM Can Connect

 Test /api/auth/login using admin/admin123 once connection is valid

 Ensure getUserByEmail() uses Drizzle to fetch from Postgres

Re-seed Admin User If Missing

 Run seed-data.ts if admin user does not exist

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  email: 'admin@naturebreedfarm.org',
  username: 'admin',
  passwordHash: hashed('admin123')
}
Test From UI

 Login from /auth with admin/admin123 and see user populated

 Auth debug panel should show User: {username: 'admin', ...}

🧠 Optional Improvements (After Fix)
 Replace hardcoded credentials with secure system (JWT + bcrypt)

 Add login test in Smart Boot Health System

 Add /auth/health endpoint to ping backend login logic
