 raising a very important point about recurring accessibility and dependency issues — especially when resolving one issue seems to cause another to reappear. This kind of "whack-a-mole debugging cycle" is frustrating and time-wasting unless you build the right system around it. Here's a full recommendation and implementation plan:

✅ Why the Issue Reappeared
The DialogContent requires a DialogTitle warning is from Radix UI and relates to accessibility best practices. This often comes back when:

A modal is refactored or re-rendered without DialogTitle

A fallback wrapper is introduced without restoring DialogTitle

The boot/CI system doesn't enforce accessibility at all

This is not a bug per se — but a missing guardrail.

✅ How We Can Catch These Automatically
🧠 1. Add a Custom Rule to the Boot Health System:
Enhance the boot system’s diagnostics to include an accessibility validator:

ts
Copy
Edit
// pseudo-logic
if (component.includes('DialogContent') && !component.includes('DialogTitle')) {
  log.warn("⚠️ DialogContent is missing DialogTitle – accessibility issue");
  status.dialogAccessibility = 'warn';
}
🧪 2. Integrate an Accessibility Linter
Use eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y in the frontend stack:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y --save-dev
Then add to your ESLint config:

json
Copy
Edit
"plugins": ["jsx-a11y"],
"extends": ["plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"]
💡 Bonus: Add a GitHub check that fails PRs if critical a11y rules are broken.

🧪 3. Create a Dedicated Boot Test: /a11y
In your boot CLI and status dashboard, add a lightweight route like:

ts
Copy
Edit
GET /api/health/a11y
Which checks:

Modal components for missing titles

Button labels for screen reader compliance

Form fields for missing <label> elements

📦 4. Developer Awareness in Docs
In the CONTRIBUTING.md, add:

Note: All DialogContent components must include a DialogTitle (or be wrapped in VisuallyHidden). This ensures accessibility for screen readers and avoids Radix warnings.

✅ Strategic Next Step
Let’s update the smart boot system with an Accessibility module, just like we did for:

Auth health ✅

DB ping ✅

Product catalog ✅

Checkout endpoints ✅

🧩 Action Plan (Ready for Devs):
 Add a11y check to smart boot system CLI and status dashboard

 Install eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y and add to CI

 Add /api/health/a11y to backend (dummy check for now)

 Update the /status UI to reflect accessibility score

 Push a new GitHub Issue: accessibility-check: modal missing title
