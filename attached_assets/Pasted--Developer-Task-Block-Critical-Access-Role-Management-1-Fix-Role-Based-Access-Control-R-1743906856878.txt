🧠 Developer Task Block: Critical Access & Role Management
🔐 1. Fix Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System-Wide
Issue: Users, including admin, are being denied access to protected routes (/orders, /dashboard, /breeding/rabbits), even with correct credentials.

Tasks:

 Audit the useAuth() hook and confirm that user.role is being set correctly after login.

 Patch the route protection logic to allow admin or superuser roles access to /dashboard, /orders, and /breeding/rabbits.

 Ensure the session persists in both development and deployed environments via JWT or cookie (must work after page reload).

 Add debug log to console and browser storage after login showing user info and roles.

🧭 2. Fix Sidebar and Quick Link Navigation (Broken or Inactive)
Issue: The sidebar buttons and quick links appear in the browser but do nothing or link to blank or broken pages.

Tasks:

 Fix or refactor the Sidebar component’s Link and onClick handlers to use wouter routing consistently.

 Visually audit all navigation items to ensure they are active, not hidden behind conditionals, and correctly displayed per requiresAuth.

 Log missing or invalid paths in browser console (auto-check on boot for broken routes).

 Optional: Add a fallback route (* → NotFoundPage) with clear call to action.

🐇 3. Rabbit Breeding Dashboard - Prepare for Wider Testing
We must ensure that /breeding/rabbits is: ✅ Displaying animal data
✅ Compatible with auth system
✅ Has stable queryFn
✅ Allows breeding event submission
✅ Loads without error or infinite spinner

Tasks:

 ✅ Fix queryFn missing issue for useQuery hook (useQuery({ queryKey: [...], queryFn: fetchAnimals }))

 ✅ Ensure the page works with AND without seeded data (graceful empty state)

 🔁 Automatically retry API connection if server restarts

 🎛️ Add "Refresh" button to manually re-fetch animal list

 🐛 Fix duplicate render or delay in rendering Rabbit cards

🧪 4. Testing Checklist
Add a test script or manual checklist for:

 Login as admin (verify token in localStorage)

 View rabbit dashboard and export PDF/CSV

 Add a rabbit event and see it appear

 Deny access for unauthenticated users

 Confirm sidebar renders correct links for user vs admin

🧭 Final Developer Reminder
Before pushing:

 Seed database with working admin: admin@naturebreedfarm.org / admin123

 Patch any /auth/login → returns 401 with proper error message (not silent)

 Push updates to GitHub and Replit simultaneously (to prevent drift)

 Confirm .env on Replit is correctly configured (especially DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET)
