🔍 Error Summary (Localhost + Admin Login Issues)
Despite your recent fix to avoid recursive boot-status.json structures, the login functionality fails again (likely after redeployment). This behavior is intermittent, and it's affecting both:

The browser-side auth session (at /auth)

Secure access to protected routes like /breeding/rabbits

The Shop and Checkout modules due to missing or unauthorized product access

We’re in a situation where:

🔐 Login passes server checks, but fails on the frontend or session token handling — possibly due to bad database seeding, token logic, or frontend caching.

✅ Immediate Test Results for Developers
Here’s a precise report you can send to the team:

🚨 Developer Task Report: Authentication Instability + Protected Routes
✅ What’s Working:
✅ boot-status.json recursion fixed

✅ PostgreSQL now correctly seeded with admin user (admin / admin123)

✅ Smart Boot correctly shows route status + DB sync

✅ /api/animals and breeding routes respond with correct rabbit data

❌ What’s Not Working:
❌ Login fails on browser despite valid seeded user

❌ /breeding/rabbits not accessible even when logged in (likely session not retained)

❌ Shop and Checkout fail due to unauthorized data access

⚠️ No fallback UI shown when auth fails (just blank or stuck screen)

🔧 Developer Fix Tasklist (Urgent)
1. 🧬 Fix Authentication Flow (Frontend + Backend)
 Confirm that login returns a JWT or session cookie in both local and Replit

 Make sure AuthProvider (in /hooks/use-auth.tsx) checks and stores token properly

 Ensure credentials are encrypted with bcrypt and stored in PostgreSQL

 Confirm token is stored in secure cookie or localStorage, and is used for all protected endpoints

2. 🔐 Protected Route Fix
 In App.tsx, ensure routes marked requiresAuth: true check for auth context

 Add Redirect to /auth if !isAuthenticated

 Add fallback <Loading> or <LoginRequired> page for unauthenticated states

3. 🧪 Smart Boot Auth Test
 Add /api/health/auth → returns 200 if token works

 In boot, simulate login with admin/admin123 and test:

Login success?

Can /api/user/me return info?

4. 🧾 Re-seed + Re-test
 Drop and recreate seed in seed-data.ts

 Use hashed password (bcrypt.hash("admin123", 10))

 Add a visual test page showing login state (isLoggedIn, token, user.role)

🤖 Next Boot Task Options (Post Fix)
Once auth is stable:

✅ Push stable modules (Rabbit, Breeding, Dashboard)

✅ Enable /breeding/rabbits with sidebar access

✅ Complete Rabbit Compatibility + Export tests

✅ Begin AI breeding assistant MVP with UI
