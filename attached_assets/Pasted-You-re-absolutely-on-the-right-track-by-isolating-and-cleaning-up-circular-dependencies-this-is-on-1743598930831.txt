You're absolutely on the right track by isolating and cleaning up circular dependencies â€” this is one of those deep but important refactors that improves stability long-term. Here's how Iâ€™d recommend proceeding:

## âœ… Short-Term Fix: Continue Troubleshooting for Minimal Disruption

Since youâ€™ve already:

- âœ… Cleaned up `storage.ts` imports to decouple from RBAC
- âœ… Moved `UserRoles` to `rbac.ts`
- âœ… Begun deduplicating auth logic

I recommend we **complete this pass-through first** to get the server running *without introducing deeper restructuring yet*.

---

## ðŸ§  But Here's the Underlying Problem:

> Circular dependencies between **auth**, **RBAC**, and **storage** suggest **tangled coupling** of logic that should be loosely bound.

This happens when:
- `auth.ts` depends on `rbac.ts`
- `rbac.ts` depends on `auth.ts` (directly or via shared `User` types)
- `storage.ts` imports both and becomes the choke point

---

## ðŸ”§ Mid-Term Solution: Modular Separation Plan

If issues persist, I suggest **light restructuring** like so:

### 1. **Create a `types/roles.ts` file**:
Move `UserRole` enum and interfaces *out of* `rbac.ts` and `auth.ts` into a neutral types file.

```ts
// types/roles.ts
export type UserRole = 'customer' | 'admin' | 'support' | 'agent';
```

### 2. **Split `rbac.ts` into pure logic utils**
Make `rbac.ts` only contain `checkPermission`, `requireRole`, etc.  
No imports from `auth.ts` or `storage.ts`.

### 3. **Storage should never import auth**
Instead, inject `user` into the function or use a service layer between.

## ðŸš¦ What I Recommend Now

### âœ… Immediate:
Continue current cleanup and finish fixing:
- `storage.ts` â†’ remove or defer auth logic
- `auth.ts` â†’ make it self-contained
- Add a `types/roles.ts` file if not already done

Then restart and test.

### ðŸ”€ If It Still Breaks:
Let me help you restructure the `auth`, `rbac`, and `storage` relationships â€” Iâ€™ll draw up a new dependency diagram + refactor steps.

## ðŸ§ª Bonus: Debugging Tip for Circular Dependency

In Node:
```bash
DEBUG=module node index.js
```

Or in code:
```ts
console.trace("Circular import triggered here");
```

Or use:
```bash
npx madge --circular src/
```

Would you like me to:
- âœ… Review your current import map and suggest exactly which lines to decouple?
- ðŸ§± Draw a new modular architecture for `auth` + `rbac` + `storage`?
- ðŸ“¦ Bundle the `types/roles.ts`, `middleware/requireRole.ts`, and label JSON so you can continue while I prep a drop-in kit?

Let me know how deep you want to go â€” we can crush this.
