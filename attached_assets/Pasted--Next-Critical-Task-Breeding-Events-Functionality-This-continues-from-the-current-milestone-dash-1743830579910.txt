🎯 Next Critical Task: Breeding Events Functionality
This continues from the current milestone (dashboard + breeding suggestions) and unlocks core functionality:

✅ Developer Task: Breeding Events Tracking Module
📌 Purpose:
To allow farmers to log, manage, and visualize rabbit breeding events like mating, pregnancy tracking, and offspring generation — the backbone of rabbit farm productivity.

  └── /routes

🧱 Subtasks
1. Frontend - Breeding Events Page
 Create a /breeding-events page (linked from dashboard)

 Display table of logged events (e.g., pairing, pregnancy, litter)

 Add modal form for logging a new event:

Select Male

Select Female

Date of Breeding

Notes

 Form validations and toast success/error messages

2. Backend API
 Create /api/breeding/events (GET, POST)

 Store events in a dedicated breeding_events table or model

 Handle linkage to animalId for parent tracking

3. Smart Boot Integration
 Add event system check: status of last event logged, last mating, etc.

 Show status on /status page inside rabbit app

4. AI Assistant Hook (Optional Phase)
 Add button: “Ask AI: Is this a good match?”

 Use GPT to suggest based on genetic data (can stub for now)

🧪 Testing
 Add a few test breeding events manually

 Verify correct stats on dashboard

 Confirm history is preserved in local DB

⚡ Bonus Enhancements
From developer proposals, prioritize these (separate tasks):

 ✅ “Playful Achievement Badges” – Reward milestones like “First Litter Logged”

 ✅ “Interactive Tour” – Step-by-step intro for breeders

 ✅ “Quick Action Floating Menu” – Add rabbit, add event, etc.

 ✅ “Offline support” (queued sync later)

🔁 Reminder: Keep this Modular
This entire functionality is still inside the /apps/rabbit-breeding micro-app so it doesn’t interfere with main app boot or routing. We’ll integrate later.
