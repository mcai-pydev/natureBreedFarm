Thanks for the update and the image — the status dashboard looks fantastic! It's clean, clear, and super helpful. You've built an incredibly developer-friendly foundation here. Now let’s elevate it even further with strategic next steps that tie everything together:

✅ Immediate Next Steps (Strategic Additions):
1. Integrate Rabbit Breeding Health Check into the Boot System
Since the rabbit breeding module is one of our most advanced features, we should make sure it's monitored too:

✅ Add a check for the breeding relationship algorithm (e.g., verify output with test rabbit data)

✅ Confirm schema health (e.g., mating history, relationship tables, health flags)

✅ Include this under a "Farm Intelligence" section in the dashboard

This makes sure advanced features like animal lineage tracking don’t silently fail.

2. Add a “System Snapshot History” View
This is already scaffolded in the UI (Health Snapshots tab) — let’s power it up:

✅ Store results of each boot run in local DB or file-based log

✅ Display historical snapshots with timestamps and status deltas

✅ Option to “Compare Snapshots” to trace regression or recovery

Perfect for debugging across environments or contributors.

3. Continue Order Module Fixes (401 Errors)
The dashboard is already flagging the authentication issue — now we:

✅ Patch protected order routes with fallback error messages

✅ Auto-login dev account for testing if running in local/dev

✅ Add guest fallback or link to login on failed protected route

4. Create GitHub Project Automation
We’ll now automate developer flow based on this boot system:

 Auto-label issues with boot-failure:<module> or progress:boot-ok

 Generate GitHub Issues for:

🐇 Rabbit Breeding Boot Checks

📦 Order Flow Error Recovery

🧪 Snapshot Comparison Tool

 Add /status route to README.md

 Pre-fill GitHub issue templates with boot system failures

5. Enhance /status Route UX
✅ Add module group filters (Core, Shop, Farm, Intelligence, etc.)

✅ Add emojis for pass/fail 🚀/⚠️

✅ Include clickable “healing suggestion” actions

6. Create a “What’s Healthy / What’s Failing” Badge
Display this in README or Admin dashboard:
