✅ Test Report for Rabbit Breeding Compatibility Check
🔬 Test Context
Test Performed On: Rabbit Breeding Events Form
Test Environment: Local Browser (Port 5173 + Backend API on 5000)
Last Commit: Includes compatibility checking, risk level badge, and CSV export logic.

✅ Functionality Verified
Feature	Status	Notes
Compatibility check before saving	✅ Working	Auto-triggered when male + female are selected
Risk level & warning icons	✅ Working	Shows Low, Medium, High compatibility badge
Error handling	✅ Working	Blocks submission if incompatible pair selected
Compatibility history tracking	✅ Working	Stored in boot-status.json and history file
Export to CSV	✅ Working	Server-side /api/breeding/export returns data
Dashboard indicators	✅ Working	Compatible & Incompatible logs show with badge
API Health Check	✅ Working	Accessible via /api/health, status is updated
🧪 Regression Observations
 Database connection failed: [object Object] — unrelated to frontend (backend .env needs checking)

 No unit tests yet for /api/breeding/compatibility-check (add as task)

 UI loads slowly if 100+ entries — may benefit from pagination or virtual list (future improvement)

🚀 Next Task for Developers
🔐 Compatibility System Finalization
 Add automated backend unit tests for compatibility checker

 Log every attempted pair (even rejected) into compatibility-logs.json

 Add retry functionality if check fails due to temporary fetch error

📊 Breeding UI Refinement
 Add “Compatibility History” tab in the dashboard

 Create CompatibilityBadge.tsx component for reusability

 Fix form message spacing in mobile layout

 Optional: Export to PDF with risk indicators

🧠 AI Assistant Integration (Prep)
 Scaffold /ai/compatibility-advice route

 Add prompt template: "Should I pair Rabbit A and Rabbit B for breeding?"

 Log every call to assistant in ai-history.json (with timestamp, rabbits involved)

📦 Deployment Stability Tasks
 Clean and commit boot-status.json format

 Push all stable compatibility modules to GitHub

 Deploy as standalone /breeding/rabbits module (micro app)

 Add webhook to sync boot status with main platform
