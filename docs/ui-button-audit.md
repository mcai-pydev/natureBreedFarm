## Action Plan

1. For each broken (❌) element, implement one of the following solutions:
   - Add missing routes in App.tsx
   - Create "Under Construction" pages for admin routes
   - Update navigation components to hide or disable broken links

2. Priority Order:
   - First: Fix Orders route (/orders) with proper navigation
   - Next: Handle all "new" item routes with under construction or redirects
   - Finally: Handle admin section routes with proper placeholders or hide if not ready

3. Implementation Plan:
   - Create an UnderConstruction component for placeholder pages ✅
   - Add proper routes for missing pages in App.tsx
   - Update navigation components to properly handle routes
   - Add error state handling for broken or disabled links
